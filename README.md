REPOSITORY #1
My name is Lai and i'm starting this adventure with zero coding experience. The only experience I have is a little bit of Linux. I'm a wife , a mom of 2 beautiful awesome girls. Im a big Harry Potter geek add GOT to that as well. I love to just binge watch great shows whenever time permits. I forgot to menton that I love FRIENDS so much that I can't even count how many times I have seen alll the episodes. I hope this new journey I'm about to start is something that will show me where I need to be...
